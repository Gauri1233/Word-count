# Word-count
The word count is a program designed to count the number of words in a given string. There are many ways to do this, but we are using for loop for this one.
The input function is used for inserting strings.
The variable name to count and the counter value of 0 have been defined
When the for loop is executed, the count value is incremented by 1. Finally, we get the number of words in the string.
